Ivoryanna Brown Netid: itb2
I started this assignment on January 22nd and finished it the same day.
It took me approximately 2 hours
I received help figuring out the instructions from my tutor, Sachet Bangia.
I liked this assignment. I got frustrated because it was a little (a lot) tedious. 
But I liked figuring out what was going wrong and I feel that it was a helpful lesson on using
comments.
