I started this earlier today and did not finish. 
I was attempting to go through each letter and count the occurrences and then find their indexes and figure out 
which are closer to the outside. I would then remove that end of the bar and go through again with the same letter 
in case the letter appears multiple time. Then when this loop is done it will return to the first loop and switch 
letters and do that over again until all repeated letters are gone...
Hopefully my idea is right....?

I worked on this for 4 hours and could not figure it out. ANd I couldn't make it to consulting...
