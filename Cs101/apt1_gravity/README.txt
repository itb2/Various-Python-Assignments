I started this assignment on January 22nd and finished it the same day.
I spent approximately 10 minutes on it. 
I received help from Hunter Stark in my lab section. I wasnt sure how to show use the results tab
to see of my code was working throughout.
I found this assignment to be easy, but at first I was doing more than I needed to do by asking 
the user for input.
